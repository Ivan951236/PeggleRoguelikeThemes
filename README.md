## Peggle Roguelike Custom Themes Database

This Database holds themes that anyone can make for Peggle Roguelike Preset Generator program, ever since it switched to Java

The Template is already in this repository in the themes\light folder, it's named "gameboy-green-light.yml"

You may also make descripiton by naming it same as your theme's filename, other than the extension is .md, basically the requirement is that it uses Markdown

You may also make a client to communcaite with this repository and install to the right directory

For now, it's purely github for file hosting

For images in the descripiton, do not upload the images directly, instead use your repository's images or use your server's storage for images and making sure you can view the images on your server's domain

You may also upload images to the images folder in the root

There is also the index for the themes using YAML to work correctly, to make clients work, it is present as index.yml file in the root

I may move your images to the uniquely named folder in the images folder in the root, using UUID as the name of such
