# Ivan's Official Theme Provider

Welcome to this Theme Provider for the program with custom themes support

Note that this repo should be installed on every theme provider client

If the client developer don't do this, they can be banned from viewing the theme provider's github repo

A Theme Provider Client should be able to read YAML files and use them probably nicely well

Once JFXS Theme Providers become more famous in their picks, this repo is no longer required to be installed on every client

About 30 JFXS Theme Providers are enough to make it "famous"

For more information about JFXS Theme Providers, please refer to the themes in this theme provider.
